# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The goal was to use a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
### Data preprocessing
	Targets - IS_SUCCESSFUL.
	Features – everything else minus the data removed from binning.
	Neither targets or Features – The data we removed with binning. 
### Compiling, Training, Evaluating Model
	Neurons- I chose 50 neurons.  Out of all my attempts to get 75% or better 50 seemed to get me the closest. 
        Layers- 2 layers seemed to work the best.  When I tried 3 layers the accuracy dropped.
        Activation functions- I used the sigmoid function.
        To get better accuracy, I played around with the number of layers and neurons. 
## Summary:
In summary I recommend playing around with Neural network play ground to try and optimize the model.  I was unable to achieve 75% accuracy or better.
